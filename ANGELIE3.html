    <p class="about-Dinawanao">
Graduation stirs a complex cocktail of emotions within me. Excitement bubbles like champagne, fueled by the prospect of new adventures and uncharted territories. 
Pride swells in my chest, a testament to years of dedication, late nights, and unwavering pursuit of knowledge. 
Yet, a bittersweet tinge lingers, whispering of goodbyes to familiar faces, comfortable routines, and the sheltered haven that fostered my growth. Fear, a masked guest, l
urks at the edges, whispering about the uncertainties that lie ahead. But amidst this maelstrom of emotions, one feeling reigns supreme: gratitude. Gratitude for the 
opportunities that brought me here, for the mentors who guided my path, and for the friends who became my family. It is this gratitude that fuels my resolve, pushing 
me to embrace the future with open arms, knowing that even though the journey ahead is paved with unknowns, it is a journey I will embark on with courage, 
determination, and the unwavering support of those who have helped me reach this milestone.</p>

    Engaging in competitive gaming, particularly in titles like Call of Duty Mobile (CODM) and PUBG, has significantly enhanced my communication skills. 
    In these games, working together with my team to plan and execute strategies became super important. Using in-game voice chats and messages, 
    I got better at sharing info quickly and adjusting how I talk depending on who I'm playing with. Meeting players from different backgrounds taught me 
    a lot and helped me connect with people. It's not just about winning in the game, my gaming skills also made me better at talking with others in real life. 
    I made new friends and expanded my social circle
