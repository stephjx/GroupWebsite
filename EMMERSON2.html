       Chapters 3 and 4: Information Processing Cycle <br> <br>                           
       I learned how information goes through steps: inputting it, processing or doing something with it, storing it, and then getting it out when needed. 
       It's like a journey for data, helping us understand how computers work.

       Chapter 5: Basic Concepts of Computer Security <br> <br>                           
       This part talked about important ideas like keeping information secret, making sure it's correct, and always being able to use it when needed. 
       It also looked into problems with staying safe on computers, like on the main system, when connected to others, and when using databases.

       Chapter 6: The Internet & World Wide Web <br> <br>                           
       Exploring the story of the Internet, I found out about its parts and how rules, services, and ways of doing things help different computer stuff work together. 
       I got the basics of how the Internet is set up and how addresses work. Also, I checked out how the World Wide Web, the programs we use to explore it, 
       and the big computers that store web pages all fit into the picture.

       This section on Basic HTML & CSS was really interesting and a bit challenging for me.  Learning how to build web pages with HTML and style them with CSS was fun and challenging. 
       It was like balancing art and coding, which made it even more interesting. Overall, it was a cool experience that made me feel accomplished and excited about what I can do in web development.
